6673	Vituzzu, the incipit as it is is semantically incorrect! in a nutshell, the conversation is not complete: (...) Italian private. As for terrorists: those who detain people against their will, try them without having the authority, or giving them the opportunity to defend themselves, condemn them to death and kill by making a video of a claim (practice that we know well in Italy as it is very similar to murder of Aldo Moro) is pure and simple terrorism and not guerrilla warfare.

Since when I read data interventions my arms fall off, I clarify for the last time: * a list that shows me who is active this week of sysop will never, ever be able to measure the fancazzismo of the admin, clear as a concept? Why can't he ever make me see fancazzismo? because in that list there are those who make an edit a week, who will always be present will therefore be eg. who does 52 edits (1 per week), who will be present 8 times is the one who does 8000 actions in 2 months what then is the purpose of this list? give immediate perception of the consistency of the number of sysops present in the week and is it useful to have this value? in my opinion yes, because the current list makes it seem that the sysop present are 100, in reality they are less. The purpose of the list is to make sure that the word pause is put on automatic. are there tools that quickly show the fancazzismo of the sysop? yes, this tool is special: contributions ignis Make me a	it	0

6857	With the intention of killing, yes, but not two sailors. This I meant. I don't think the term accident annihilates the investigators' thesis. Either way, Case is fine too. The important thing, in my opinion, is that the title be carried over to the real casus, because this includes everything else, that is the legal matter, the dispute between India and Italy, the mourning of the fishermen's families .... Of course, it is only the spark, but it explains all the fire. This, on an NPOV level, is not the marò case and the diplomatic crisis, if it exists, is a consequence of a fact that must remain at the head of the topic of voice. Anyway I did a little test: I searched for incident + lexie on thehindu.com site and the expression incident (the term chosen on enW) occurs very often. However, it must also be said that the Italian translation of the term is not univocal, as it could mean both an accident, a clash, and a crime. Or even fact, event, although the Latin root, with its etymological significance, imho remains standing.	it	0

This is part of our ongoing efforts to provide new and better tools to our users, such as interwiki notifications. As a result, each user will have the same username on all projects. This will make possible new functions for better editing and discussing, as well as more flexible user permissions. Specifically, usernames will now need to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia projects. For more information, read the announcement. Unfortunately, another person uses your username, Duccio, elsewhere. To make sure that both of you can contribute to our projects smoothly in the future, your username will be changed to Duccio ~ itwiki. If you like it, you don't need to do anything; but you can request a different username. Your account will work exactly as before and will be credited with any changes you have made, but you will need to use your new username to log in. We apologize for the inconvenience.

3297	You are completely out of the way. If I add the title of singer-songwriter to Eugenio Montale, even if I find sources absurdly, it should be removed because Montale has written books and has not recorded records. De André has made records and has not written poetry books. It seems so simple to me to understand. The sources must be analyzed: there are, to give you an example, hoping you will understand it, sources that say that De André recorded Nuvole barocche in 1958, WHAT IMPOSSIBLE because in 1958 Karim did not even exist, since it was founded in 1961. If one if he leaned on those sources, he would write WRONG information. So, in this case, I repeat it to you: I HAVE SOURCES that qualify as poets Vecchioni, Ciampi and Mogol, but I DO NOT WRITE the word Poet in their voices, leaning on them. Because it is NOT true: they wrote songs, perhaps with poetic aspects, literally poetic, but they did NOT write poems (.... which is not true because, at least, Vecchioni has also published poetry books).

6522	Hello, Oliviero Malaspina falls within the automatic encyclopedicity criteria provided for in: Help: Encyclopedicity criteria / Music groups and artists In fact: 1. We have (at least) two albums not self-produced and with national distribution, since the debut (see: The Subsidiary: OLIVIERO MALASPINA / From Fabrizio to Cristiano De André: the new album): CARAVAGGIO (Peer Southern Italy / CNI) - Note: CNI stands for Compagnia Nuove Indye, which has national distribution HAI! YOU HAVE! YOU HAVE! (Peer Southern Italy / CNI) WELCOME MONSTERS (2002, Target / Sony) etc. We are therefore largely above the fateful 2 albums ... 2. Concerts, tours, festivals of national importance: City of Recanati Prize, Faber fragile friend concert in 2000 with many of the greatest Italian artists, various solo tours, Fabrizio De André summer 1998, etc. Therefore, this point too is not disputable. 3. The aforementioned concert Faber Fragile Friend is a sufficient example: from the concert a double CD was also obtained (in 2003); another example is Musicultura (also broadcast on rai radio). Since the criteria of encyclopedicity seem to me to be largely outdated, I certainly delete the notice of dubious encyclopedicity. Hello Marco Ciaramella (msg)	it	0

The problem was that this fanaticism, this intolerance, was so widespread and lasted so long through the centuries, that it seemed almost murderous (and this is so serious). the other religions (certainly all those revealed).

The concrete, what I want to do is replace all the templates of the profiles of the various athletes with new American Wiki-style templates in order to have profiles that we have useful data within them, such as jersey number, role, university and much more. I hope to find confirmation from you too, in order to include you in a future official proposal once you have obtained the ideal number of consents, obviously citing you as a supporter and future modifier.

For now, I'll bring it back here, waiting to find accommodation. Margot Sikabonyi plays, in two episodes, Elena, Alessandro's girlfriend, but she is threatened by Stanis (Pietro Sermonti) who perceives the air of crisis between the two. In reality, the actress, at the time, was Sermonti's real girlfriend. Margot Sikabonyi and Pietro Sermonti, moreover, star among the main actors, in the role of boyfriends, in the fiction A doctor in the family, which represents precisely that type of Italian-style fiction that Boris' satire focuses on.	it	0

Anyway, it's good to know. My idea, in any case, was to speak of university colleges as institutions, regardless of the religious factor. Of course, it is also true that the historical ones are almost always religious. I would say that perhaps treating them as cultural or historically / sociologically important entities in city life could work. Or arrange them in the part concerning the University. I was thinking especially of the Collegio Antonianum, which has seen generations of university students pass by and which also has the historic Auditorium, home to cultural initiatives such as theatrical performances, concerts (often from the University's Art Center), conferences, and the legendary Cineforum.	it	0

Reading what you write, you confirm that your goal is precisely to set non-criteria, because to say that bishops who are authors of relevant facts are encyclopedic means nothing, except to leave room for the most complete discretion. @Nicolabel: restoring the wording of relevant facts is of no use, since the criteria are sufficient anyway; I agree on the higher connotation of diocesan structures; on the elimination of the reference to institutional relations with politics I am neutral; on the modification of the last inscription on the archbishops, it seems to me that what is written now means just what you also mean, and that is that bishop or archbishop makes no difference, unless the archbishop is encyclopedic for other reasons.

This is part of our ongoing efforts to provide new and better tools to our users, such as interwiki notifications. As a result, each user will have the same username on all projects. This will make possible new functions for better editing and discussing, as well as more flexible user permissions. Specifically, usernames will now need to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia projects. For more information, read the announcement. Unfortunately, another person uses your username, Maxmorgan, elsewhere. To make sure that both of you can contribute to our projects smoothly in the future, your username will be changed to Maxmorgan ~ itwiki. If you like it, you don't need to do anything; but you can request a different username. Your account will work exactly as before and will be credited with any changes you have made, but you will need to use your new username to log in. We apologize for the inconvenience.

So I just added the .tv piece in half (www.satnews [.tv] .it /), after verifying and making sure that the new url http://www.satnews.it/vbforum/member.php? u = 875 worked.

3528	Jaqen: This is Millet's book (on Genet, see from p. 336) and this is a review. Homosexuality and heterosexuality do come in (but not only those). Rocker: "it is not necessary to name specificities except for specific reasons," you write. And in fact here there is a precise reason and I do not take anything for granted. The sentence is "Millett notes how the first three [Lawrence, Mailer, Miller] see in the woman" an annoying minority force to trample and aim at a social order in which the female would be perfectly dominated ", while the homosexual Genet" etc. It was implied that, when writing "while the homosexual Genet", s indicated in the other three as many heterosexuals. But if that's not clear, let's just change the sentence to "Millett notes how the first three - heterosexuals - see in woman" etc. I agree.

6912	well it seems absurd to me the excessive use of such threats the term dictator does not constitute an insult at all, but it is a word that marks the behavior, from my point of view, of an inconsistent use of the block, which if it will be carried out also in this case, will confirm what I say dictator is the one who arrogates to himself the power to act exulting others, THIS IS AN INSULT ??? WE SEE THAT WE ARE LESS HYPOCRITES, because following this line then I can consider insult even if you do not know the career of del piero, which was told to me by a user and which implies my ignorance in this topic AND I HAVE NOT ALLOWED TO CENSOR IT , AS THE CENSORSHIP IS JUST ONE OF THE WEAPONS OF A DICTATOR	it	0

7664	In addition to this edition, someone, ignoring the guidelines, damned the incipit by removing important information on the subject (which had been inserted for months and which weighed less than 1 Kb occupying just under 2 paragraphs, very little compared to decidedly more trivial information that still remains in other sections of the item and which takes up more space such as statistics, clubs and fans) and also complete wikilinks such as the one on the evolution of the Italian football league, if wikilinks for individual years such as the one in 1897 are despecified because they insist on inserting them ? The phrase "primacy of 33 scudetti" (however badly wikilinked) is confused in so much it, in addition to being localist (outside Italy no one calls a scudetto in the league, if not [Italian] championship [Serie A], but football) is only an accessory of the competition (the previous sentence was better because it referred to the guiridic title (champion of Italy) conferred by the Federation after the final victory of the competition of greatest sporting value and ratified through an official press release, also because the word championship is repeated excessively in the first paragraphs of the entry and series A is not to be used as it is an anachronist who does not enter with the period 1898-1929). 190.236.206.	it	0

4382	But you will do the vandalism yourself! What are you saying? What are vandalisms? Where is the wrong information? The truth is that since you have no arguments to justify an absolutely non-encycopledic page like this one, which does not warn readers about the dangers of seaside tourism in Reggio and which is full of partial and incomplete information, you use arrogance to defend the page.

6763	It seems crazy to me that in the paragraph where we talk about Hackerino's video this is proposed as absolute truth. It seems hardly encyclopedic to me not to use at least hypothetical periods, that is: we should limit ourselves to describing what is shown in the video not to use terminology as they managed to connect, of which there is no proof. Incidentally, anyone with a degree in computer science knows that what is proposed in the video is blatantly false (seeing the abominable amount of grammatical errors shown on the video: do you really think that things work like this?), But okay, I would at least be satisfied that the voice was a little more neutral.

1537	Thank you for your interest in the change I made to the Indian tennis player's voice. I had removed the sentence on the Youth Olympics simply because the sentence was already written (and not by me) a few lines below, as you can personally see with a simple (but complete) reading of the entry. I thought it more consistent to keep the second quote of the sentence, in the Professionals paragraph given that, as the ATP website indicates, the tennis player has been a professional since 2008 and therefore a 2010 result is more correct than it remains written in the paragraph relating to the professional career. Having said that, I believe I can safely return to the text prior to your cancellation. Unless it is more useful to repeat the same information twice in a (however skimpy) page Markokramit (msg)	it	0
