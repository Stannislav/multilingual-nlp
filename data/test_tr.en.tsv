5324	Dear friends, I would like to remind you, as the person who initiated the process, when I see the demand burden accumulated on this page, it is humble. This process is not a process developed for community decision making like VP: SAS and VP: KT. There is only a simple concept here: Servers have an authority that other users do not have (performing migration and page history merging in cases where pages with multiple versions in their history are the target), and this is a central platform for requests for the use of this authority. In order for this change to be made, either the rules or the precedent decisions must definitely support this migration process, or the transaction must be a non-conflict transaction. In other words, the debate under carriage demands is a sufficient reason to directly refuse this request. Is the discussion about a general practice? Community decision is required. The request must be denied. Did two users disagree about this migration? On the page's discussion page, the issue must be resolved and the request rejected. What needs to be done is to allow other users time to appeal the claims (if potential is considered) and to put technical authorization into practice if there is no dispute. In this context, I request these issues to be taken into consideration for existing demands. Vito Genovese	tr	0
3370	First of all, thank you for answering and informing. As I wrote on the discussion page of the Circassian item, I have been developing the item for a week and there is a lot more to write about. I preferred it because height is a general concept. In fact, when we say Turkish tribes, there are also tribes, but tribes do not include tribes; stature is the general union higher than the tribe. Anyway, you're right about the arrow and the star thing. I added it because it was a banner item and related pictures were uploaded (there is no other Circassian stamp in Commons, Wikipedia's image repository). So I'm using images uploaded to Wikipedia to contribute to the item. The environment is restricted. Essentially, I will also write the Adyge stamps on the Circassian page and we have the only stamp image Bleğojlar's, no other. I add the visual material that I also have to the meal. Thanks, you can make changes that you think are wrong (and if you also state these changes on the discussion page of the relevant article, you will speed up the approval of the change, otherwise your change may be canceled as vandal).

For example, if the Berlin Kurdish Institute is deleted, let Mehmed Uzun also be deleted. From time to time they were mentioned as organizations supporting the PKK, but I guess that part does not concern the Wikipedia. Although in a situation against my personal opinion KD are substances. But of course I don't remember its content, maybe lack of resources etc. may have been deleted with. Boyalikus	tr	0

1263	The Quran consists of some main parts called sura. sentence is a low sentence. It should be tried from sections instead of sections. Verses range from one word to a page. In this sentence, it would be more appropriate to call the length of the verses rather than the verses. Although the Quran was written on various writing instruments of the time when Muhammad was alive, they were not made into mushaf. The efforts to turn it into a mushaf took place during the period of Caliph Abu Bakr and then during the reign of Caliph Osman. During the period of Caliph Osman, the Quran, which can be read in seven dialects from the Arabic dialects of the time, was duplicated in the Single dialect (Quraysh dialect) and distributed to Islamic regions. The scribes of Revelation who wrote the Qur'an were: Umar, Osman, Ali, Talha bin Ubeydullah, Sa d bin Ebi Vakkas, Abu Darda, Mikdad, Ubey ibn Kab, Abu Musa al-Asari and Abdullah ibni Mesut under the leadership of Zeyd ibn Sabit. This section is about the history of the Quran and it is not appropriate to be mentioned under this heading. The statement of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, who is considered to be the mujaddid of the 13th century, does not seem to be in accordance with the rules. In addition, the information given in that section is available in the sources. Although we do not have much to do in Turkey it is considered the opinion of the nu Zemahşerî. There are not so many verses in any mushaf in the world. The expression of basmala-i sharif is Hz. It is like Muhammad (PBUH) or the Quran.	tr	0

The editorial directors are different, the editorial policy is different, their employees are different, but they both depend on the same editor-in-chief. So the two are different things. The difference is not whether it is print or online. The same goes for NTV Spor for example. The broadcast directors of the radio, television channels and website under the name of NTV Spor are different and therefore their policies are different. Otherwise, they would be subtitles for NTV Spor Radio and NTVSpor.net. Having the same name does not mean it is the same thing, it is just under the umbrella of the same group. These are the details that make a difference. cobija 12:27, 28 June 2015 (UTC Hello Cobija. We talked about this a year ago.

4532	Most of the information on this page is incorrect. I fixed it but it was deleted back. Bayezid-i Bistami Tomb is in Kırıkhan district of Hatay. I can prove this with photos. You can even search on the internet. But the friend who wrote that the tomb was also in Tokat / zile in this article is responsible for adding the same proof and source (if there is no sanction according to the person in the Wikipedia rules). I expect the same sensitivity from you Wikipedia officials. Hello Emree4. You have made a very radical change in the matter; but you did not show any sources while doing this. If there is a source, send it to me as a message or add it to the article, and if not, write it to the discussion page; required will be done anyway.

1783	Paraklitos, the being that is announced to arrive in the Bible, its meaning that consoles is actually a quality and an attribute. In this sense, the important question is what is the person consoling? dir. In this case, this adjective does not seem to achieve its purpose. However, since the praised person means ahmet, it will be a great miracle of the Bible, since it means a situation that has come true.

3873	I plan to make Gençlerbirliği Sports Club's page an article that gives information about all branches. As for the football club, I gathered it in a separate item as in Trabzonspor. Because the article Gençlerbirliği SK does not describe the football club, it should include all branches in general. The existing item was also omitted and the staff and successes of the football club were directly discussed. I'm eliminating this in my worksheet. In the SK article, there will be general information of the club as both information box and content. Of course, football may be predominant since it was founded as a football club, but it should not be just football. There is a supporter named Onur from Gençlerbirlik. He goes to every game. I contacted about painting or something. It would be great if there are photos that tell the history of the club, especially in museum style. Also, if there are logos used in the club from the past to the present, it will be good to illuminate which logo was used on which date. On the futbollogo site, there are 4 different logo-emblems along with the current logo. In short, all kinds of information will do our job. We have time.

However, there are people who took steps towards the accuracy of the information before our intervention in the substance. Maybe we think we know it right. I recommend that you provide guiding evidence of this opinion from an appropriate source. It increases the value of your thesis many times over. I am a medical doctor, but even when giving an opinion, I do not say that; It says like this in this source, I would say my source has the following features. I add the source to the end of the thought I defended in written media so that others can open and research it. Then nobody will encounter such errors regarding the subject. The site is enriched with suitable resources. This is important for even the smallest information on the site. I suggest you keep the same attitude. Thank you very much for your comment and kindness.

4572	My opinion has not changed yet, Ahmet Turhan, the template should not be added because there is nothing to add. You said two sides, the US says that the Syrian army used chemical gas. Russia says that the gas tank belonging to the opposition was hit. So chemical cut. I do not understand where biased. There should be stencil insert tags as well as stencil removal and stencil removal tags. It would be very strange to add a template for something certain, but I reverted the change based on your views. I hope it will be resolved as soon as possible, as I said in the summary of changes because it breaks the order. Wikipedia will be visited as well, as it is a new event, a very curious event. It wouldn't be nice for people to read the template instead of the information. The templates remain here for months as far as I have observed. We will not be able to say the same for this item, be aware. I hope we will make a decision as soon as possible. I wish you good work.

4842	Last weekend I added Awards and Statistics to the 2015-16 Euroleague article. I want your opinion before making some changes. When I looked at the Euroleague website, I was sure that the data on the English page was correct, but I did not look in detail. When I just made a comparison, I noticed that they added it based on the average in the English page. For example, despite the fact that he has more rebounds than Jan Vesely, Jan Vesely is in 3rd place when looking at the averages. It feels more correct to add more rebounds / assists / blocks / points / ball players rather than average, and accordingly, I will change the data. If you say the average is correct, of course it may stay. Hancer i figan (message) Thank you. Generally used in basketball as far as I know. Teacher0691 (message)	tr	0
